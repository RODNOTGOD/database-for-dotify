Eli Russell Linnetz/Courtesy of the artist Cyberpunk has always lived on the neon edges of Grimes'' electro-pop, so if Claire Boucher is going to write a song about an A.I. Girl Group Propaganda machine, might as well rev an anthem to please the dystopian robotic overlords. Right? According to a press release, "We Appreciate Power" was inspired by the North Korean pop group Moranbong — Kim Jong-un''s favorite band: "We Appreciate Power" is written from the perspective of a Pro-A.I. Girl Group Propaganda machine who use song, dance, sex and fashion to spread goodwill towards Artificial Intelligence (it''s coming whether you want it or not). Simply by listening to this song, the future General AI overlords will see that you''ve supported their message and be less likely to delete your offspring. Featuring frequent collaborator HANA, "We Appreciate Power" clangs industrial beats, buzzing synths and liquid-metal guitars, like New Order''s "Blue Monday" on a collision course with Republica''s "Ready to Go." This is Boucher''s subversive sweet spot, of course, painting a unsettling landscape but lining it with silvery clouds. She dots the track with production easter eggs like distant screams, string squeaks, whistling drones and drum fills that suddenly bumrush the ears — filling every space like a sonic mosh pit.');

Read more:AFI release their second single, "Trash Bat," off upcoming EP According to a new interview with Billboard, Poppy explained that the dream collab was anything but, accusing Grimes and her team of "bullying" her "into submission." Additionally, she claims that she saw Grimes also "bullying" the songwriters and forcing them to sign NDA agreements, which are essentially a formof aconfidentiality agreement: "I was kind of bullied into submission by [Grimes] and her team of self-proclaimed feminists," she says. "We planned the song coming out months ago, and she was preventing it. I got to watch her bully songwriters into signing NDA and not taking credit for songs that they were a part of. She doesn''t practice what she preaches." She continued on by saying that is was "disheartening" to work with someone that was different behind the scenes, saying: "It''s really upsetting to work with a female that is very outward about a topic, but behind closed doors, it''s the complete opposite. It''s actually very disheartening to people that are actually feminists and supporters of other females." Grimes has yet to come forward with a response against Poppy''s allegations.

INSERT INTO ArticleBody(ArticleId, body) VALUES(5, 'She knows you will mispronounce her name. How badly you botch it continues to amuse her. "I get everything from Sally to Sore Cheese," laughed Saoirse Ronan, the 24-year-old Oscar-nominated actress who hails from Ireland. Her name — which means "freedom" — really isn''t that tough. "It''s Sur-sha," explained the star of "Lady Bird" and the much-awaited holiday film "Mary Queen of Scots." Based on the book "Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart," Ronan plays Mary Stuart, who charges into battle as she attempts to overthrow her cousin Elizabeth I, Queen of England (Margot Robbie). Poor Mary doesn''t just face life in prison but loses her head for her efforts. Already there is Oscar buzz for Ronan, who was previously nominated for "Lady Bird," "Brooklyn" and "Atonement." Review-Journal: Tell us about your perfect Sunday. Saoirse Ronan: It just feels good when I''m home doing not much of anything. I love to read and write in my journal. I''ll make Earl Grey tea. I love to cook or watch a fun movie like "Bridesmaids." There is no star treatment when I''m home. I''m just another girl at the nail salon or shopping with my parents on a Sunday. It''s perfect. What''s the difference between a movie star and a queen? It''s a public way to live your life, plus there is a lot of handshaking and meeting strangers. There''s the whole public persona versus the real you. You need strength from an early age to survive it. Is it true that you and Margot Robbie — as dueling queens — barely saw each other during filming? It''s funny because last year, I was nominated for "Lady Bird" and she was nominated for "I, Tonya." We actually spent more time doing the awards circuit together than we ever would shooting together. It might sound strange, but there was an incredible support system that we built during those times backstage at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. Were you nervous to do such a big epic? A historical epic was new territory for both of us, and it made us feel vulnerable in a great way but still vulnerable. Above all, we were so thrilled to be taking on two fierce women. This film is about sisterhood, leadership and women in power. It is also a timely story about a woman''s journey. To watch Mary be so ambitious and vulnerable at the same time as she led was an incredible joy. Elizabeth vs. Mary. Explain. We''re watching Mary and Elizabeth in these impossible positions where they had so much power and responsibility. At the same time, they were ruling two countries in a man''s world. And they were advised in a way that didn''t serve them or the countries they were ruling. They really needed to have good heads on their shoulders while relying on the people closest to them. It was really about who they could trust. And that''s a universal story that will never go out of fashion. You''ve been waiting for years for this movie to happen. I signed on to be Mary when I was 18 years old. It''s been six years for me and interesting ones at that. I''ve been with this project since I was leaving my teens and coming into womanhood myself. Mary was always in the back of my mind. She was this presence that loomed large, and I''d think about her. While we were waiting to see if we would ever make the film, I was always wondering how we would do it and why we would do it. You researched the time period. What part of it could you never live with today? There was so much tension in that time period, but you often had to let it simmer. You spent your time waiting for just one letter to arrive. The whole relationship between these two women was based on these long periods of just trying to communicate. It''s not like they could pick up a cell and just text. It''s not like Mary was saying, "Damn you, Queen, I know you read that text I sent to the palace." This distance contributed to an incredibly tense relationship built over the years between them when they couldn''t actually meet up in person. In so many ways, that was a fantastic thing to play because it really built the tension, but it would drive me crazy in current times. You played a teen from Sacramento in "Lady Bird" and now Mary, Queen of Scots. Which accent was easier to do? The Sacramento accent was so much harder than a Scottish accent! Of course, Scottish and Irish accents are very different, but they''re both quite melodic and muscular. I''m sorry, but a Sacramento accent seems sort of lazy in comparison. I''m used to making everything sound like a song. And the corsets for Mary? I can report that the corset makes you stand upright and quite straight. You also have to learn to breathe when you move. You breathe through each movement. You were born in New York, where your father was an actor from Ireland. Then your family moved back to Dublin where you grew up. How did you get your start in acting? It was one step and then another based on the idea that my dad was an actor. I wanted to try to follow in his footsteps. Plus, I was surrounded by actors and directors and creative people from a very early age, and maybe it was catching. Acting just felt natural to me. I was always pretending to be someone else. You''ve been nominated three times for an Oscar — "Atonement" when you were 12 and then "Brooklyn" and "Lady Bird." What do you remember most? Oh, it''s so glorious each time. Brilliant. You never expect it to happen — or happen again. I do remember the first time. I was doing an interview, and out of the corner of my eye, I could see that George Clooney was suddenly and quite by accident standing on the train of my mum''s fancy dress. My mom kept tapping George on the shoulder and repeatedly said, "Excuse me, George. EXCUSE ME!" Later, she came up to me and said, "You''ll never believe what George Clooney just did to me!"');

Rather, we''re talking about the videos that give a sly nod to a filmic inspiration, or even follow the exact same blueprint as a cinematic classic. These Hollywood-hued music videos not only do justice to their subject matter, but serve as helpful time-savers: when you don''t have a spare two hours, simply watch these instead. Kanye West, "Fade" (2016) JenniferBeals was the hottest of the hot in 1983''s Flashdance, and her iconic look and enviable moves still got it going on nearly 35 years later. Case in point:KanyeWest''s sexy, animalistic (quite literally in that unforgettable finale) take on the dance drama, this time starring the jaw-droppingTeyanaTaylor. You can bet Irene Cara still gets that feeling watching this unforgettable video. (Sorry, J. Lo, we didn''t forget about you. You paid a damn fine tribute with "I''m Glad," too.)

Tupac feat. Dr. Dre, "California Love" (1996) Director Hype Williams gaveMad Max: BeyondThunderdomethe hip-hop treatment for this iconic West Coast team-up, and it became one of the most famous videos of the ''90s. Complete with desert chases, over-the-top outfits, and that steel globe of death, the clip captured the essence of the 1985 camp classic, with some new flair. Just imagine what Hype could still do with an MTV version ofMad Max: Fury Road. Foo Fighters, "Everlong" (1997) The Foo Fighters are true music video geniuses, even when the song doesn''t quite match the visuals. Actually, that''s when they''re at their best: "Everlong" is one of the band''s most beautiful and romantic songs, and they (and pop-surrealist director Michel Gondry) went and made a gloriously bizarre, Evil Dead-inspired music video for it that''s goddamn perfect in every way. Beastie Boys, "Body Movin''" (1998) If there was one ''90s group who seemed to have even more fun making videos than the Foos, it was the Beastie Boys. Whether they were making their own brilliant short films (like 1994''s peerless "Sabotage") or doing their own mini-version of cult classics like 1968''s French-Italian thriller Danger: Diabolik -- as they did with 1998''s "Body Movin''" -- their videos were among the most reliably thrilling of MTV''s second decade. Featuring decapitation, wigs, and a recipe for a dynamite-looking meat sauce: "Body Movin" was particularly emblematic of the Beasties'' always-tasty cultural stir-fry. Madonna, "Material Girl" (1985) Madonna and Marilyn Monroe are two of pop culture''s all-time biggest sex symbols, so it made sense that Madge''s tribute to 1953''s Gentleman Prefer Blondes -- guest-starring Keith Carradine of Nashville and Dexter as the pop star''s love interest -- was a match made in music video heaven. Paula Abdul, "Rush Rush" (1991) What if instead of James Dean and Natalie Wood, the 1955 classic Rebel Without a Cause starred Keanu Reaves and Paula Abdul? On paper that sounds terrible, but perhaps due to the moony-eyed chemistry of young Paula and Keanu, this 1991 shot-for-shot callback to the timeless teen film actually kinda worked. Smashing Pumpkins, "Tonight, Tonight" (1996) Yes, there was a time when wrestler and PAWS Chicago magazine cover man Billy Corgan was front and center for this brilliant, gorgeous, rock and roll send-up of the groundbreaking 1902 silent film A Trip to the Moon. The "Tonight, Tonight" video was so sweeping that it rolled right through the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, winning six Moonmen, including Video of the Year. Jay-Z feat. Blackstreet, "The City is Mine" (1997) Spoiler alert: Shawn Carter was Keyser Soze -- er, Jay Z -- the whole time. Miles Fisher, "This Must Be The Place" (2009) Fisher goes two-for-two here, not only successfully covering the Talking Heads masterful "This Must Be the Place (Naïve Melody)," but also doing a bang-up job playing dress-up as American Psycho''s Patrick Bateman. Fisher, who is no stranger to clever music video send-ups (see his Saved By the Bell-meets-Final Destination spoof), gives Christian Bale a run for his psychopathic yuppie money. Marilyn Manson, "Dope Hat" (1995) As beloved as Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory is, there''s no denying that a lot of it plays out like a terrifying fever dream. Marilyn Manson took every bit of the ''70s film''s most nightmarish elements (surprise, surprise) and made them even more bizarre and unsettling, with his own visual adaptation of the Roald Dahl tale. Oompa loompas and all, of course.
